SHONGO WEB CLIENT

TECHNOLOGY

-client is written in Java programming language
-Spring MVC web framework is used
-Jetty embedded http server is used for running the client

RUN

Configure IntelliJ IDEA to run "cz.cesnet.shongo.client.web.ClientWeb.main". If you put "client-web/src/main/resources"
in "Program arguments" then the Jetty will be configured to use all resources (JSP, .properties, etc.)
from the source folder ("client-web/src/main/resources") and you can apply, e.g., runtime modifications to JSPs.
Otherwise it uses the resources from "client-web/target/classes" and you won't be able to apply runtime modifications
and you have to restart application every time you make a change.
