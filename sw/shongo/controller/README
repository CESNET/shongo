HIBERNATE NOTES

1) If OneToMany association without mappedBy attribute is declared as java.util.List, deletion of one item
   cause delete all items and insert all that should not be deleted.

2) Associations should by mapped by field access. Getter should return unmodifiableList or unmodifiableSet, setter
   should not be present and addXXX/removeXXX methods should be present.

3) If association is bidirectional we must take care of sync of both sides.
