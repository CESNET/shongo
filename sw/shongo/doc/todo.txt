* 2 paragraphs of shongo features

* String aliases
  -test connectors with ROOM_NAME alias (require ROOM_NAME alias and remove code attribute from Room)
  -remove shongo-test room from mcu (or changes its number to the last from the assigned interval)

* Max future - different for resource reservations/alias reservations (add maxFuture to AliasProviderCapability)

* info mails
  -implement for aliases
  -hide identifiers (move to end)

* Improve value generation performance

* Web client
  -now button in date picker
  -sort week days in date/time pickers (Mo Thu ...)
  -use one getReservations instead of multiple getReservation requests

* Improve allocation failed reports
  -Max-future

* log all connector actions

* Update API                                   -
  -reservation - reservationRequestId, name
  -controller configuratio
  -ValueProvider, AliasProvider
  -RoomProviderCapability->requiredAliasTypes
  -AliasType.ROOM_NAME
  -remove RoomSpecification.withAlias

* check H.323 prefix for shongo (01 doesn't work, "shongo-test" has it assigned)

* Adobe Connector
 - single connection
 - thread safety

* Clien-CLI Shell.pm in parse_attributes the resulting hash should be processed and all json
  bool objects should be converted to 1/0

* Use HangUp instead of HangUpAll

* Implement better web client "back button"

* Alias specification - request H323 and SIP too

* H.323 room endtime

* Refactorize web client to mod_perl

* Web clients - H.323 and Adobe Connect
  - runtime management (room, participants)

* Soft delete of reservation requests

* Permanent reservation
  - forced maintenance option
  - permanent reservation should try to reallocate all colliding reservations

* Make Cache thread safe (Scheduler and ResourceServiceImpl can cause reset() which reloads cache, and while
  the cache is reloading no one can use it)

* Create expiring user cache in the controller

* Implement allocation failed state to permanent reservations

* Refactorize Room.Options

* Add deviceResource attribute to Alias and fill it when the alias is evaluated on the DeviceResource and check
  assignment of this alias to proper DeviceResource

FUTURE:
-------
* Controller should check RoomProvider devices if theirs configured capacity doesn't exceed the real one and
  warning should be displayed if so (we don't have to force error message)

* Test cmd-line client in mvn test (Run cmd-line client test in maven testing)

* Use database migration (change database to some which allows for transaction ddl, e.g., postgresql)
  - Implement multiple dialects

* Create tests for Converter (and simplify Converter.convert() method)

* Persons, PersonSpecifications

* Add requested alias value attribute to AliasSpecification

* API synchronizovat pomoci
