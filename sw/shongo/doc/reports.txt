1. COMMON REPORTS
-----------------

  Common reports are stored for each reservation request when it is being created, modified or preprocessed.

 * Specification Not Ready
   - when a PersonSpecification (in the CompartmentSpecification) is not accepted or rejected by the requested person
   - when the report is stored, the reservation request is in "NOT_COMPLETE" state (and it won't be scheduled until
     it is "COMPLETE")


2. SCHEDULER REPORTS
--------------------

  Scheduler reports are stored for each reservation request which is being allocated by the Scheduler.

 * Specification Not Allocatable [ERROR]
   - when a specification for a target which cannot be allocated is specified in the reservation request
     (e.g., ExternalEndpointSpecification make sense only inside the CompartmentSpecification)

 * Duration Longer Than Maximum [ERROR] (duration : Period, maxDuration : Period)
   - when a resource is requested for longer duration than the maximum configured in the controller.
   - when a value is requested for longer duration than the maximum configured in the controller,
     value must be reserved for each alias reservation

 * Provided Reservation Not Available [ERROR]
   - is already used by another reservation

 * Provided Reservation Not Usable [ERROR]
   - the time slot of the provided reservation doesn't contain the whole
     requested time slot

 * Resource Not Endpoint [ERROR]
   - when ExistingEndpointSpecification references a resource which isn't a device or doesn't have TerminalCapability

 * Resource Not Found [ERROR]
   - when LookupEndpointSpecification hasn't found any available endpoint

 * <Allocating Resource> (resource : Resource)

     # (if) Resource Requested Multiple Times [ERROR]

     # (if) Resource Not Allocatable [ERROR]

     # (if) Resource Not Available [ERROR]

     # (if) Reusing Provided Reservation [OK]

     # [OK]

 * <Allocating Alias> (technologies : Technology[], types : AliasTypes[], value : String)

     # Finding Available Resources [NEXT|ERROR]

         * (loop) Available Resource

     # Sorting Resources

     # (loop) <Allocating Resource> [OK|CONTINUE]

         * (if) Value No Available [ERROR]
                 - all possible values are already allocated

         * (if) Value Already Allocated [ERROR]
                 - requested value is already allocated

         * (if) Value Invalid [ERROR]
                 - requested value doesn't match the pattern of the value generator

     # [ERROR]

 * <Allocating Room> (technologySets : Technology[][], participantCount : int)

     # (if) Reusing Provided Reservation [OK]

     # Finding Available Resources [NEXT|ERROR]

         * (loop) Available Resource

     # Sorting Resources

     # (loop) <Allocating Resource> [OK|CONTINUE]

         * (if) Allocating Room

         * (if) Reusing Room

         * (loop) <Allocating Alias> [CONTINUE|NEXT]

         * [OK]

     # [ERROR]

 * <Allocating Connection from # to #>

     # (if) Cannot Create Connection To External Endpoint Set [ERROR]

     # <Allocating Alias> [OK|ERROR]

         * (if) Cannot Assign Alias To External Endpoint [ERROR]

     # [OK]

 * <Allocating Connection>

     # Allocating Connection from Endpoint#1 To Endpoint#2> [OK|NEXT]

     # Allocating Connection from Endpoint#2 To Endpoint#1> [OK|ERROR]

 * Allocating Compartment

     # (if) Not Enough Endpoints [ERROR]

     # (if 2 endpoints) <Allocating Connection> [OK|ERROR]

     # (else) <Allocating Room> [NEXT|ERROR]

     # (loop) <Allocating Connection> [CONTINUE|ERROR]

     # [OK]

 Explanatory Notes:

    (if)
        represents that some condition is checked, and the report is generated only in some cases
    (loop)
        represents that the report can be generated zero or more times
    [OK]
        the report represents a successful allocation and the scheduling task is immediately exited
    [ERROR]
        the report represents an error and the current allocation is immediately exited
    [NEXT]
        the scheduling task continues to the next action
    [CONTINUE]
        the scheduling task continues to the next loop cycle
    [@1|@2]
        if the current allocation which is described by the report succeeds, then the report is considered as @1,
        otherwise the report is considered as @2 (the @1 and @2 can be any of [OK], [ERROR], [NEXT], [CONTINUE]).


3. EXECUTION REPORTS
--------------------

 Execution reports are stored for each executable (virtual room, compartment, etc).

 Types:

 * Command Failure (command : String)

   - Represents a failure of a command which was sent to a connector agent. Attribute 'command' stores the
     name of the command (e.g., 'CreateRoom').

   - Possible types:

      # Agent Not Found (agentName : String)
         -: receiver agent (in connector) is not available
         -> try again

      # Agent Not Started (agentName : String)
         -: sender agent (in controller) is not started yet
         -> try again

      # Timeout
         -: sender agent hasn't received the response in specified period of time
         -> try again

      # Not supported
         -: receiver agent does not implement (support) the requested command
         -> report to resource administrator

      # Error (message : String)
         -: receiver agent throws CommandException while processing the command,
            the 'message' attribute stores the exception message
         -> report to resource administrator

      # Refused
         -: receiver jade agent refused the request
         -> report to shongo administrator

      # Not Understood
         -: receiver jade agent didn't understand the request
         -> report to shongo administrator

      # Result Decoding Error
         -: sender jade agent cannot decode the response
         -> report to shongo administrator

      # Unknown Failure (message : String)
         -: receiver agent has thrown undeclared exception or some other unknown problem has happened
         -> report shongo and resource administrator
