0.5.1 (2013-04-05)

    * Fixed assigning user roles for the case when user creates an alias reservation,
      then a room capacity reservation for the alias and then assigns a new owner
      to the room capacity reservation.

    * Propagating user roles to devices (e.g., Adobe Connect) which are created while
      reservation is already in "started" state

    * Sending internal error reports to configured Shongo administrators

    * Scheduler and Executor are now mutually exclusive

    * ACL records are stored inside the Controller and only few of them are propagated to authorization server
