\chapter{Reservations}

A request for a reservation of videoconference devices and other resources can be created by a Shongo user via console or web interface of a domain controller. The user become the request owner. Each reservation request belongs to a domain controller where it was created and the request is stored there. A reservation request can be in one of these states:
\begin{compactenum}
\item \textbf{Not-Complete} \\
  When a reservation request is created it is considered as incomplete 
  because all requested participants should confirm presence in
  the videoconference first.
\item \textbf{Complete} \\
  A reservation request is considered as complete when each participant 
  confirms or rejects the presence in videoconference. Some of
  requested participants should also choose a device which they will use 
  to connect to the videoconference (will be described).
\end{compactenum}
Every domain controller is running a scheduler which process complete requests and tries to schedule them. If the scheduling was successful, the result is a reservation. Through the console or web interface a reservation request owner is able to watch his request state and also a potential scheduled reservation state. The owner can modify or delete his reservation request and thus also a potential scheduled reservation. The owner and all the reservation participants should be notified about changes in the scheduled reservation (e.g., by email or SMS). 

A reservation request consists of time slots specifications, specification of requested resources and/or participants that should take part in the videoconference and a set of options that can modify the scheduling process. Reservation request may be used to book multiple videoconference calls (e.g., every Wednesday or two specific dates). A reservation request can specify following types of entities to take part in videoconference(s):
\begin{compactenum}
\item \textbf{Resource known to Shongo} \\
  A resource that is stored in the controller database and it has assigned 
  a resource identifier by which the resource is requested for 
  a reservation. Known resources can represent:
  \begin{compactenum}
  \item A specific resource in the controlled domain. It is usually 
  managed device and thus the controller can control and schedule it.
  \item An external resource that is often used in reservations. It is 
  usually external unmanaged terminal device stored in the controller database
  to not force the user to describe it every time when he want to use it in 
  a reservation (actually it is stored version of resource unknown to Shongo).
  \end{compactenum}
\item \textbf{Resource unknown to Shongo} \\
  A resource that is described as part of the reservation request. Usually 
  represents an external terminal device. It must specify at least technology 
  (or technologies). It is useful, e.g., for requesting videoconference 
  of 5 unknown users that can connect via SIP or H.323.
  
  \vspace{1mm} To each requested known/unknown resource can be assigned a 
  list of persons, that will use the resource to participate in the 
  videoconference(s). Known resources can have the list assigned permanently 
  and in this case it is automatically filled into all reservations requests 
  in which  the resource is specified. 
\item \textbf{Virtual Room} \\
  A virtual room can be requested for a videoconference reservation. A device
  in which the virtual room should be allocated may be specified. The size
  of the virtual room should be specified (number of allowed participants).
  Virtual rooms allocated in this way are used at first to connect 
  requested endpoints.
\item \textbf{Person} \\
  Instead of specifying a resource the reservation request can specify a 
  specific  person to participate in the videoconference(s) and the person 
  himself choose the device that he will use for connecting to the 
  videoconference(s). The person can be requested in two ways:
  \begin{compactenum}
  \item By specifying an user identity in Shongo.
  \item By specifying a name and contact (e.g., email or cell phone).
  \end{compactenum}
\end{compactenum}
When a person is requested to participate in a videoconference (by a resource or directly), the controller should contact him (e.g., by email or by SMS with link to a web page) and ask whether he want to accept the invitation. If the person was requested directly the controller should also ask the person which device he will use to connect to the videoconference. If the person was specified by a user identity the controller can build a list of available devices to him and the person can select from them. The person can also specify a device that is unknown to Shongo. 

The videoconference reservation can be scheduled only when the request is complete, i.e., all the requested persons have accepted or rejected the invitation and all directly requested persons have selected devices by which they will connect. Until this condition is met the reservation request is in incomplete state.

\TODO{How to specify different devices to different events (in case of multiple videoconferences)? Perhaps user should choose a device separately for each event...}

Set of options is a part of the reservation request and it can modify the scheduling process of a reservation. It can contains one or more options from the following types:
\begin{compactitem}
\item inter-domain lookup option tells that the controller is allowed to look for necessary devices also in foreign domains (e.g., for a MCU that is not available in local domain).
\item preference whether a terminal should dial a MCU or a MCU should dial a terminal. This preference can be specified globally for the whole reservation or separately for each device.
\end{compactitem}
Each device resource should specify whether it is callable from other devices or if it should initiate all calls by itself.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Reservation request of a single videoconference for 4 anonymous persons in H.323.

\begin{EntityExample}{ReservationRequest}{reservationRequest1}{}
type: Science,
requestedSlots: [DateTimeSlot(2012-05-18T15:30, P1H)],
requestedResources: [
  ExternalEndpointSpecification { // 4 guests (unknown H.323 devices)
    technologies: [H323],
    count: 4
  }
]
\end{EntityExample}

\item Reservation request of a single videoconference for 4 persons. The first person  has assigned a device in resource database and thus the request owner selected it. Other two persons don't have assigned device in resource database so the request owner specified that they will connect by specific H.323 phone numbers. One H.323 guest can also connect to the videoconference.

\begin{EntityExample}{DeviceResource}{terminal1}{Mirial for Martin Srom in resource database}
technologies: [H323], 
aliases: [{type: E164, value: 95001}],
