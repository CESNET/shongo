\section{Communication Protocol}

\todo{Merge with XML-RPC description. Afterwards, just state, what is used for which communication acts (XML-RPC for user interface, Jade ontologies for Jade messaging). Use common failure codes. Groups of failure codes: Shongo-connections, connections between a connector and its device, failures reported by the devices themselves}

Communication among controllers and connectors is implemented using JADE \cite{jade}. The communication is \textbf{synchronous}, i.e., the controller sends a command to a connector and waits until the connector replies. All messages are encoded using the FIPA SL content language \cite{FIPA-SL}. An ontology, called |ShongoOntology|, is used by communicating agents to give the same meaning to the symbols used in messages. This section describes the way commands defined by this API are composed to messages and interpreted by Shongo agents.

The ontology used by all agents consists of concepts, predicates, and agent actions.
\begin{description}
\item[An agent action,] tagged by |jade.content.AgentAction| interface, expresses a request what should the receiving agent do. Each of the commands specified in this API document is defined by a class implementing |AgentAction|, declaring all the command arguments as attributes accessed by public getters and setters.
\item[A predicate,] tagged by |jade.content.Predicate| interface, expresses a claim about a fact. In this API, we use just two predicates defined in the JADE framework, for the purpose of expressing result of a command. We use no custom predicates.
\item[A concept,] tagged by |jade.content.Concept| interface, is any entity which may be a part of an agent action or a predicate. All object types of arguments or return values must be specified as concepts for the agent content manager to be able to properly encode them in messages. In particular, any such a class must implement the |jade.content.Concept| interface and reside within the |cz.cesnet.shongo.jade.ontology| package for the |ShongoOntology| class to be able to find it and comprise it in the ontology used for encoding messages.
\end{description}


For example, the |setMicrophoneLevel(int level)| command, defined in section \ref{sect:connector-endpoint-api}, might be specified by the following class:
\begin{verbatim}
package cz.cesnet.shongo.jade.ontology;

public class SetMicrophoneLevel implements AgentAction {
    private int level = 0;

    public int getLevel() {
        return level;
    }
    public void setLevel(int level) {
        this.level = level;
    }
}
\end{verbatim}
The |setMicrophoneLevel| call implementation instantiates a new |SetMicrophoneLevel| object, sets up the |level| attribute, and passes the object to a controller agent content manager to send it to an endpoint as a |request| communicative act \cite{FIPA-ComActSpec}. The corresponding endpoint agent creates the |SetMicrophoneLevel| object received from the controller agent and implements the requested functionality according to it. The message sent during such a call might be similar to the following:
\begin{verbatim}
(REQUEST
 :receiver  (set ( agent-identifier :name dev@127.0.0.1:1099/JADE ) )
 :content  "((action (agent-identifier :name
     Controller-Main-Container@127.0.0.1:1099/JADE :addresses (sequence
     http://localhost:7778/acc)) (SET-MICROPHONE-LEVEL :level 46)))"
 :language  fipa-sl  :ontology  shongo-ontology )
\end{verbatim}

The agent receiving a command should always send a reply as an |inform| \cite{FIPA-ComActSpec} message. In case of commands without any return value, a |Done| predicate from the package |jade.content.onto.basic| should be sent as a reply, denoting a successful command execution. When a return value is expected, a |Result| predicate, defined in \cite{FIPA-SL}, is sent, filled with the value to be returned. The same requirements apply to the class of the object to be returned as for command object arguments -- the class must reside within the |cz.cesnet.shongo.jade.ontology| interface and be tagged by the |Concept| interface.

An example of a complex command is shown in appendix \ref{appendix:jade-command-encoding}.

\section{Common API}

\begin{Api}

\ApiCmd{ConnectorInfo getConnectorInfo()}

\ApiCmd{setPlaybackLevel(SecurityToken token, String RoomUserId, int level)}
Sets playback audio level of a user in a room to a given value. Note that the implementation differs between multipoint and endpoint types of devices. On an endpoint, the playback level is set using the device amplifier, while calling this on a multipoint device results in software adaptation of the output sound data (which may result in a distorted sound).

\ApiCmd{enableUserVideo(SecurityToken token, String RoomUserId)}
Enables video from a user in a room.
