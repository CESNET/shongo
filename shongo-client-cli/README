REQUIREMENTS

This client requires Perl installed to run and following Perl modules:
 1) Term::ReadKey
 2) File::Which
 3) Term::ReadLine::Gnu
 4) RPC::XML
 5) XML::Twig
 6) Text::Table
 7) DateTime::Format::ISO8601
 8) JSON
 9) IO::Socket::SSL (version 1.56)
10) LWP::Protocol::https


On Ubuntu/Debian system, Perl is installed by default and the modules
can be installed by the following command:

    sudo apt-get install libterm-readkey-perl libfile-which-perl \
        libterm-readline-gnu-perl librpc-xml-perl libxml-twig-perl \
        libtext-table-perl libdatetime-format-iso8601-perl \
        libjson-perl liblwp-protocol-https-perl


On OSX (Yosemite), you should first install Xcode, Perl is part of
the Command Line Tools. Install CPAN in Terminal to add modules:

    cpan App::cpanminus

Install all the Perl modules above except number 3) and instead install Term::ReadLine::Perl.
(causes SetHistory method not found) find replacement
You should use 'sudo' to avoid errors due to Library folder being locked.

    sudo cpan -i Term::ReadKey File::Which Term::ReadLine::Perl \
        RPC::XML XML::Twig Text::Table DateTime::Format::ISO8601 \
	JSON IO::Socket::SSL LWP::Protocol::https
	 

On other platforms the modules can be installed by CPAN utility:

    cpan -i Term::ReadKey

The CPAN can be used even on the Ubuntu/Debian system to upgrade Perl modules, e.g. to install
the latest version of IO::Socket::SSL (package libssl-dev is needed):

    sudo apt-get install build-essential
    sudo cpan -i IO::Socket::SSL
