views.help.introduction.text=Terms and conditions under which personal data collated in providing the CESNET e-infrastructure services are processed you can find <a href="https://www.cesnet.cz/cesnet/documents/privacy/?lang=en" target="_blank">here</a>.
views.help.introduction.text2=You can create a new room from <a href\="{0}" target\="_blank">main page</a> or from page with \

views.help.loa=Level of authenticity
views.help.loa.text1=Only logged in user with a certain level of authenticity can create a new room or book a capacity for existing room. \
If you see <b id\="warning" class\="fa fa-warning" style\="color\: \#f71;"></b> next to your name in the top of the page, \
it means that your account doesn't meet the requested level of authenticity. In this case you have two options\:
views.help.loa.text2=Request your identity provider to verify your identity (e.g., if you use <a href\="http\://hostel.eduid.cz/en/index.html" target\="_blank">hostel</a> identity, you can follow this <a href\="http\://hostel.eduid.cz/en/overeni_identity.html" target\="_blank">procedure</a>).
views.help.loa.text3=Request the <a href\="{0}">system administrators</a> to grant you the permissions to create new rooms and book room capacities.

views.help.rooms.text=When you want to create a new room, you can choose between two types of rooms\:
views.help.rooms.display=View more detailed description of each room type
views.help.roomType.display=View more detailed description of room type
views.help.roomType.ADHOC_ROOM.description=One-time room can be used for a single <b>conference call</b> and it's duration <b>is limited within days</b>. \
The room is available for participants to join for <b>the entire booked period of time</b> and \
when it expires it is removed. If you book multiple one-time rooms you can get rooms with \
<b>different identifiers</b> (e.g., different names, H.323 numbers and Adobe Connect URLs).
views.help.roomType.ADHOC_ROOM.positive=simple creation of the room for one conference call
views.help.roomType.ADHOC_ROOM.negative1=room is removed after expiration
views.help.roomType.ADHOC_ROOM.negative2=room identifiers (e.g., different names, H.323 numbers and Adobe Connect URLs) change
views.help.roomType.ADHOC_ROOM.example=You can imagine the one-time room as a room with a table and a specific number of chairs \
that you have booked for your meeting. Participants can come at the appointed time, sit down \
and the meeting can begin. Before the end of the booked period of time you have to leave the room \
and then it can be used for other purposes. It may happen that every meeting will take place \
in different room (e.g., the first meeting in <b>${views.help.roomType.ADHOC_ROOM.example.room1.name}</b> \
and the second meeting in <b>${views.help.roomType.ADHOC_ROOM.example.room2.name}</b>).
views.help.roomType.ADHOC_ROOM.example.room1.name=Room X
views.help.roomType.ADHOC_ROOM.example.room1.description=One-time room for 4 participants
views.help.roomType.ADHOC_ROOM.example.room2.name=Room Y
views.help.roomType.ADHOC_ROOM.example.room2.description=One-time room for 8 participants
views.help.roomType.PERMANENT_ROOM.description=Permanent room can be used for <b>multiple conference calls</b> (e.g., periodic meetings). \
The room can be created for longer period of time (a number of years), but <b>throughout the period it isn't automatically available</b> \
for participants to join. For each conference call in the permanent room <b>you must book capacity</b>, \
which determines how many participants will be able to join to the room. \
The advantage of the permanent room is that the room get assigned identifiers (name, H.323 number or Adobe Connect URL) \
and these identifiers don't change throughout the room's existence (naturally if you don't request a change). \
Thus <b>the identifiers are the same for all conference calls</b> that take place in the permanent room.
views.help.roomType.PERMANENT_ROOM.positive1=one room for multiple conference calls
views.help.roomType.PERMANENT_ROOM.positive2=room get assigned identifiers which don't change
views.help.roomType.PERMANENT_ROOM.negative=it is necessary to additionally book capacity for each conference call
views.help.roomType.PERMANENT_ROOM.example=You can imagine the permanent room as a room with a table, but without chairs. \
Therefore participants cannot just come and sit down to take a meeting, but someone \
has to &bdquo;prepare chairs&rdquo; in advance for every meeting.
views.help.roomType.PERMANENT_ROOM.example.room.name=My room
views.help.roomType.PERMANENT_ROOM.example.room.description=Permanent room
views.help.roomType.PERMANENT_ROOM.example.capacity=Once you prepare chairs in the permanent room (i.e., book requested capacity), participants can enter the room, \
sit down and the meeting can begin. For each meeting you can prepare different number of chairs. \
The room is situated in the same building on the same location and it's invariable labeled \
(with <b>${views.help.roomType.PERMANENT_ROOM.example.room.name}</b>) and therefore all meetings take place at the same location.
views.help.roomType.PERMANENT_ROOM.example.capacity1=Capacity for 4 participants
views.help.roomType.PERMANENT_ROOM.example.capacity2=Capacity for 8 participants
views.help.resources=Resources
views.help.resources.text=Reservation system manages hardware and software equipment (referred to as <b>resources</b>), \
which provides the creation and management of virtual rooms. Each resource has only a limited \
number of licenses that can be used at a time. For instance if you want to join an Adobe Connect \
room, the resource must have at least one available license, otherwise it won''t allow you to join \
the room. After joining the room the license is consumed and after leaving the room the license is \
released. To be able to guarantee a specific number of participants to be able to join to every room, it is necessery \
to book the licenses in advance. That is the reason why you must explicitly book a requested capacity \
for each room when you want to use it (e.g., when creating a new <a href\="{0}">one-time room</a> or \
when booking a capacity for <a href\="{1}">permanent room</a>).
views.help.resources.example=You can imagine the resource as a building in which few rooms are located and the limited number of \
licenses you can imagine as chairs located in this building and which may be moved between the rooms. \
Each room can contain different number of chairs at different times. For every meeting in every room, \
the chairs must be booked in advance, otherwise it may happen that participants won't be able to sit down.
views.help.resources.example.label=A building may contain, e.g., 20 chairs
